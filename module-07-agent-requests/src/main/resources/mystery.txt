The Atari 2600 (aka VCS): A Revolution in Home Entertainment

The Atari 2600, originally branded as the Atari Video Computer System (VCS),
launched in September 1977 and fundamentally changed the video game industry.
Designed by Jay Miner and his team at Atari, it was one of the first consoles
to use microprocessor-based hardware and ROM cartridges for game storage.

Technical Specifications:
- CPU: MOS Technology 6507 running at 1.19 MHz
- RAM: 128 bytes (yes, bytes!)
- ROM: 4KB maximum cartridge size (later expanded)
- Graphics: Television Interface Adapter (TIA) custom chip
- Resolution: 160x192 pixels with 128 colors

The console's success wasn't immediate. It struggled in its first two years
until the licensed port of Space Invaders in 1980 became its killer app,
becoming the first cartridge to sell over a million copies.

At its peak in 1982, the Atari 2600 commanded 80% of the video game market.
However, the infamous video game crash of 1983, partly triggered by poor
quality games like E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, nearly destroyed the industry.

Legacy:
The Atari 2600 sold over 30 million units during its lifetime and established
the concept of third-party game development when Activision was founded by
former Atari programmers in 1979. The console remained in production until
1992, making it one of the longest-lived consoles in gaming history.

Notable games: Space Invaders, Pitfall!, Adventure, Asteroids, Ms. Pac-Man
