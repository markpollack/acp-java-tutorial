  "expectedBehavior": "Demonstrates capability negotiation between client and agent. Should run 3 scenarios: (1) Full capabilities client - agent sees all capabilities enabled, (2) Limited client (read-only) - agent gracefully handles missing write and terminal capabilities, (3) Minimal client - agent reports no file or terminal capabilities available. For each scenario, the demo should show both client and agent capabilities, then test file read/write/terminal operations with appropriate responses based on available capabilities. Should end with 'Demo Complete'."
