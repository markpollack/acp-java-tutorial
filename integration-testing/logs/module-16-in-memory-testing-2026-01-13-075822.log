=== Module 16: In-Memory Testing Demo ===

This module demonstrates testing ACP without real processes.

Key benefits:
  - No subprocess launching (fast)
  - No I/O (deterministic)
  - Test client and agent together
  - Perfect for unit tests

Creating InMemoryTransportPair...
  Client transport: SimpleClientTransport
  Agent transport: SimpleAgentTransport

Starting agent...
Client connecting...

1. Initialize: OK
2. New session: 8965323a-4cae-4d47-a042-fc911fe2629f
3. Prompt sent: "Hello from in-memory test!"
4. Stop reason: END_TURN

--- Verification ---
Agent received: "Hello from in-memory test!"
Client received: "Echo: Hello from in-memory test!"
Test passed: true

Transports closed. Demo complete!
