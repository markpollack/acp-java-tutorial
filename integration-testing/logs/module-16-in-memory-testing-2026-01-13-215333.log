=== Module 16: In-Memory Testing Demo ===

This module demonstrates testing ACP without real processes.

Key benefits:
  - No subprocess launching (fast)
  - No I/O (deterministic)
  - Test client and agent together
  - Perfect for unit tests

Creating InMemoryTransportPair (from acp-test)...
  Client transport: InMemoryClientTransport
  Agent transport: InMemoryAgentTransport

Starting agent...
Client connecting...

1. Initialize: OK
2. New session: e3be150a-ba5c-4acb-9fa2-b609748cf955
3. Prompt sent: "Hello from in-memory test!"
4. Stop reason: END_TURN

--- Verification ---
Agent received: "Hello from in-memory test!"
Client received: "Echo: Hello from in-memory test!"
Test passed: true

Transports closed. Demo complete!
